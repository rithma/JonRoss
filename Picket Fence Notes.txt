Picket Fence Notes


If you stack a bunch of oscillators to cover a band of frequencies
in equal steps, each higher in frequency than the last, the resulting
spectrum is called a picket fence. 

You can see an example of this spectrum by pressing READ WAVEFORM on the
program "Wavanal*", directing it to the file:
"200Hz-680Hz in 20 Hz steps with equal amplitudes"

Setting the START FREQUENCY to 100 - 
the STOP FREQUENCY to 800 - 
and the INTERVAL to 0.1 Hz 
and pressing DO TRANSFORM in the TRANSFORMS group of controls.
Up will come a display
of 25 equally spaced spectral peaks. In the WAVEFORM group of controls,
you can listen to the resulting sound (PLAY WAVEFORM) and also look
at it on an oscilloscope (VIEW WAVEFORM). 

The Fourier synthesis makes what is essentially a set of exactly tuned
oscillators all running in lock-step to a common reference frequency.
The temporal waveform looks a lot like the picket-fence spectrum that
made it: a series of blips: one in time, one down a glissando of 
frequencies. Interesting case

A comb filter can be made by feeding the output of a mixer back into
itself through a very short delay. If one temporal cycle of the 
waveform of a note fits exactly within the delay time, it will feedback
into the mixer so as to reinforce itself. This holds true for two 
complete cycles or three or any integer number of repetitions of the
waveform. The same can be seen in the colors of oil-films floating on
water. The light reflects off of the top of the oil, travels through 
the very small thickness of the oil film and, after this delay,
reflects again off the oil-water interface. The two reflections mix in
the air. The frequencies of the ambient light that lined up in integer
cycles within the film's thickness are quite sharply aided (the
apparent thickness changes with the viewing angle). The result is a
series of peaks going down the spectrum. There is no spectral peak
or simple combination of colors for the color of silver metal. Silver
is actually a picket-fence spectrum on 50nm centers: about seven 
equally spaced peaks spanning the visual range of wavelengths from
400nm to 700nm (1000nm = 1um... 1000um= 1mm... so our light is about
one half of one thousandths of a milimeter wide). Metallic colors
are seen in oil films.

An interesting peculiarity of the sounds and waveforms of picket-fence
pattered spectrums is how robust they are to the loss of individual 
spectral peaks. In "200Hz-680Hz 20 Hz apart with missing peak", I've
clipped away a random peak by setting its amplitude to zero in its 
PARTIALS file. There is no real difference to hear or even to see on
the oscilloscope. Yet, if you look at the TRANSFORM spectral display,
the peak is cleanly gone. 

The ability to hide missing peaks from casual view offers a means of
encryption. One of 28 peaks gives the alphabet, at the crudest.
In "200Hz-680Hz 20 Hz apart with many missing peaks", a multiplicity
of peaks are missing.

If the rigid spacing of peaks is disturbed by dithering or randomizing
their frequencies, the sounds and waveforms mellow out into something
more interesting. If the amplitudes are windowed, shaped into an
dome as they approach and leave the center frequency, the mellowing
can be greater.
